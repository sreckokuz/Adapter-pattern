# Adapter-pattern

## Kada imamo slucaj da jedna funkcionalnost u aplikaciji prati jedan interfejs, a druga drugi, a obje funkcionalnosti su slicne, tada postoji mogucnost za primjenu adapter paterna. Adapter predstavlja klasu koja omogucava komunikaciju izmedju dva interfejsa. Pogledati primjer iznad.

There are three categories in design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral.
Creational patterns provide a way to make objects, while hiding the creation logics, rather than
instantiating objects directly. In short, they deal with object creation mechanisms.
Creational patterns: Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Object Pool, Prototype, Singleton

**Structural** patterns are all about class, and object composition. 
This design pattern tends to ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.
Structural design patterns: **Adapter**, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Fa√ßade, Flyweight, and Proxy.

Behavioral patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects, that is, 
how objects communicate with each other.
Behavioral patterns: Observer, Strategy, Command, Chane of Responsability, Template Method...
